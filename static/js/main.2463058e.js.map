Among\n\t * other things, this allows you to animate CSS properties.  For example, you\n\t * can do this:\n\t *\n\t *     var tweenable = new Tweenable();\n\t *     tweenable.tween({\n\t *       from: { transform: 'translateX(45px)' },\n\t *       to: { transform: 'translateX(90xp)' }\n\t *     });\n\t *\n\t * `translateX(45)` will be tweened to `translateX(90)`.  To demonstrate:\n\t *\n\t *     var tweenable = new Tweenable();\n\t *     tweenable.tween({\n\t *       from: { transform: 'translateX(45px)' },\n\t *       to: { transform: 'translateX(90px)' },\n\t *       step: function (state) {\n\t *         console.log(state.transform);\n\t *       }\n\t *     });\n\t *\n\t * The above snippet will log something like this in the console:\n\t *\n\t *     translateX(60.3px)\n\t *     ...\n\t *     translateX(76.05px)\n\t *     ...\n\t *     translateX(90px)\n\t *\n\t * Another use for this is animating colors:\n\t *\n\t *     var tweenable = new Tweenable();\n\t *     tweenable.tween({\n\t *       from: { color: 'rgb(0,255,0)' },\n\t *       to: { color: 'rgb(255,0,255)' },\n\t *       step: function (state) {\n\t *         console.log(state.color);\n\t *       }\n\t *     });\n\t *\n\t * The above snippet will log something like this:\n\t *\n\t *     rgb(84,170,84)\n\t *     ...\n\t *     rgb(170,84,170)\n\t *     ...\n\t *     rgb(255,0,255)\n\t *\n\t * This extension also supports hexadecimal colors, in both long (`#ff00ff`)\n\t * and short (`#f0f`) forms.  Be aware that hexadecimal input values will be\n\t * converted into the equivalent RGB output values.  This is done to optimize\n\t * for performance.\n\t *\n\t *     var tweenable = new Tweenable();\n\t *     tweenable.tween({\n\t *       from: { color: '#0f0' },\n\t *       to: { color: '#f0f' },\n\t *       step: function (state) {\n\t *         console.log(state.color);\n\t *       }\n\t *     });\n\t *\n\t * This snippet will generate the same output as the one before it because\n\t * equivalent values were supplied (just in hexadecimal form rather than RGB):\n\t *\n\t *     rgb(84,170,84)\n\t *     ...\n\t *     rgb(170,84,170)\n\t *     ...\n\t *     rgb(255,0,255)\n\t *\n\t * ## Easing support\n\t *\n\t * Easing works somewhat differently in the Token extension.  This is because\n\t * some CSS properties have multiple values in them, and you might need to\n\t * tween each value along its own easing curve.  A basic example:\n\t *\n\t *     var tweenable = new Tweenable();\n\t *     tweenable.tween({\n\t *       from: { transform: 'translateX(0px) translateY(0px)' },\n\t *       to: { transform:   'translateX(100px) translateY(100px)' },\n\t *       easing: { transform: 'easeInQuad' },\n\t *       step: function (state) {\n\t *         console.log(state.transform);\n\t *       }\n\t *     });\n\t *\n\t * The above snippet will create values like this:\n\t *\n\t *     translateX(11.56px) translateY(11.56px)\n\t *     ...\n\t *     translateX(46.24px) translateY(46.24px)\n\t *     ...\n\t *     translateX(100px) translateY(100px)\n\t *\n\t * In this case, the values for `translateX` and `translateY` are always the\n\t * same for each step of the tween, because they have the same start and end\n\t * points and both use the same easing curve.  We can also tween `translateX`\n\t * and `translateY` along independent curves:\n\t *\n\t *     var tweenable = new Tweenable();\n\t *     tweenable.tween({\n\t *       from: { transform: 'translateX(0px) translateY(0px)' },\n\t *       to: { transform:   'translateX(100px) translateY(100px)' },\n\t *       easing: { transform: 'easeInQuad bounce' },\n\t *       step: function (state) {\n\t *         console.log(state.transform);\n\t *       }\n\t *     });\n\t *\n\t * The above snippet will create values like this:\n\t *\n\t *     translateX(10.89px) translateY(82.35px)\n\t *     ...\n\t *     translateX(44.89px) translateY(86.73px)\n\t *     ...\n\t *     translateX(100px) translateY(100px)\n\t *\n\t * `translateX` and `translateY` are not in sync anymore, because `easeInQuad`\n\t * was specified for `translateX` and `bounce` for `translateY`.  Mixing and\n\t * matching easing curves can make for some interesting motion in your\n\t * animations.\n\t *\n\t * The order of the space-separated easing curves correspond the token values\n\t * they apply to.  If there are more token values than easing curves listed,\n\t * the last easing curve listed is used.\n\t * @submodule Tweenable.token\n\t */\n\t\n\t// token function is defined above only so that dox-foundation sees it as\n\t// documentation and renders it.

Among\n * other things, this allows you to animate CSS properties.  For example, you\n * can do this:\n *\n *     var tweenable = new Tweenable();\n *     tweenable.tween({\n *       from: { transform: 'translateX(45px)' },\n *       to: { transform: 'translateX(90xp)' }\n *     });\n *\n * `translateX(45)` will be tweened to `translateX(90)`.  To demonstrate:\n *\n *     var tweenable = new Tweenable();\n *     tweenable.tween({\n *       from: { transform: 'translateX(45px)' },\n *       to: { transform: 'translateX(90px)' },\n *       step: function (state) {\n *         console.log(state.transform);\n *       }\n *     });\n *\n * The above snippet will log something like this in the console:\n *\n *     translateX(60.3px)\n *     ...\n *     translateX(76.05px)\n *     ...\n *     translateX(90px)\n *\n * Another use for this is animating colors:\n *\n *     var tweenable = new Tweenable();\n *     tweenable.tween({\n *       from: { color: 'rgb(0,255,0)' },\n *       to: { color: 'rgb(255,0,255)' },\n *       step: function (state) {\n *         console.log(state.color);\n *       }\n *     });\n *\n * The above snippet will log something like this:\n *\n *     rgb(84,170,84)\n *     ...\n *     rgb(170,84,170)\n *     ...\n *     rgb(255,0,255)\n *\n * This extension also supports hexadecimal colors, in both long (`#ff00ff`)\n * and short (`#f0f`) forms.  Be aware that hexadecimal input values will be\n * converted into the equivalent RGB output values.  This is done to optimize\n * for performance.\n *\n *     var tweenable = new Tweenable();\n *     tweenable.tween({\n *       from: { color: '#0f0' },\n *       to: { color: '#f0f' },\n *       step: function (state) {\n *         console.log(state.color);\n *       }\n *     });\n *\n * This snippet will generate the same output as the one before it because\n * equivalent values were supplied (just in hexadecimal form rather than RGB):\n *\n *     rgb(84,170,84)\n *     ...\n *     rgb(170,84,170)\n *     ...\n *     rgb(255,0,255)\n *\n * ## Easing support\n *\n * Easing works somewhat differently in the Token extension.  This is because\n * some CSS properties have multiple values in them, and you might need to\n * tween each value along its own easing curve.  A basic example:\n *\n *     var tweenable = new Tweenable();\n *     tweenable.tween({\n *       from: { transform: 'translateX(0px) translateY(0px)' },\n *       to: { transform:   'translateX(100px) translateY(100px)' },\n *       easing: { transform: 'easeInQuad' },\n *       step: function (state) {\n *         console.log(state.transform);\n *       }\n *     });\n *\n * The above snippet will create values like this:\n *\n *     translateX(11.56px) translateY(11.56px)\n *     ...\n *     translateX(46.24px) translateY(46.24px)\n *     ...\n *     translateX(100px) translateY(100px)\n *\n * In this case, the values for `translateX` and `translateY` are always the\n * same for each step of the tween, because they have the same start and end\n * points and both use the same easing curve.  We can also tween `translateX`\n * and `translateY` along independent curves:\n *\n *     var tweenable = new Tweenable();\n *     tweenable.tween({\n *       from: { transform: 'translateX(0px) translateY(0px)' },\n *       to: { transform:   'translateX(100px) translateY(100px)' },\n *       easing: { transform: 'easeInQuad bounce' },\n *       step: function (state) {\n *         console.log(state.transform);\n *       }\n *     });\n *\n * The above snippet will create values like this:\n *\n *     translateX(10.89px) translateY(82.35px)\n *     ...\n *     translateX(44.89px) translateY(86.73px)\n *     ...\n *     translateX(100px) translateY(100px)\n *\n * `translateX` and `translateY` are not in sync anymore, because `easeInQuad`\n * was specified for `translateX` and `bounce` for `translateY`.  Mixing and\n * matching easing curves can make for some interesting motion in your\n * animations.\n *\n * The order of the space-separated easing curves correspond the token values\n * they apply to.  If there are more token values than easing curves listed,\n * the last easing curve listed is used.\n * @submodule Tweenable.token\n */\n\n// token function is defined above only so that dox-foundation sees it as\n// documentation and renders it.
